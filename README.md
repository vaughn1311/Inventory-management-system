# Inventory-management-system

Project for a class where I had to make a Inventory management system with a GUI using java/javafx. 

It had very specific requirements so won't see anything else used here.

Can use plenty of improvements/cleanup but things are left in due to the grading rubric/requirments given. 

Can download and run in an IDE to try it out!

It keeps track of listed products along with associated parts for those products. Can add, modify, and delete along with a search function.
